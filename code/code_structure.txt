Code structure for experiments:

Specifications:
	- 3 datasets x 2 : 1-vs-1 and 1-rest (MNIST, USPS, VJ)
	- 1 NLP dataset 1-vs-rest only.
	- may be one mixed dataset (a few of all tasks)
	- synthetic dataset

	- input parameters:
		datasets 				- one of all above
		algorithm 				- the alg to test
		b vector				- the alg parameter
		g			 			- agressiveness parameter, relevant only for agressive version
		a vector		 		- prior vector, relevant only for prior version (maybe can extructed from simple perceptron)
		runs					- number of runs


	- output:
		w	- The seperator vector
		queried 			- The queried tasks at each round
		margin 				- margin of the every task at each roun
		train_err			- The train table vector of each task at each 
		train_err_quried  	- The train error of the queried task
		train_err_total 	- number of erroes for each task

Structure:
	linux script: 
		loop over datasets,
		loop over algorithms
		loop over b params

	MATLAB code:
		input: dataset, algorithm and b value
			for every run:
				for every example:
					- compute margins
						- 1st/2nd order
					- predict
					- compute distribution
						- regular
						- prior
						- 2nd order
					- draw task
					- update task
						- regular
						- aggressive
						- second order
				test
					- 1st/2nd order
